# Weak law of large numbers demo 

This repository contains `R` code to run a simulation of the weak law of large numbers which tells us that as you increase the number of trials or samples, the average of these samples gets closer and closer to the true average (or mean) of the entire population.

- Flip a fair coin
- If the coin lands heads, then call it a success
- Flip again and count the number of consecutive heads
- Repeat 5000 times
- At each step compute the share of heads
